# Trace RAI

A comprehensive tracing and monitoring system for Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence (RAI) applications with built-in observability, performance tracking, and debugging capabilities.

## Overview

Trace RAI is designed to provide deep visibility into RAI systems by capturing, analyzing, and visualizing the complete flow of data through retrieval, augmentation, and generation processes. It helps developers and researchers understand system behavior, optimize performance, and debug issues in complex AI pipelines.

## Features

**Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end trace collection across microservices and AI components
**Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics for latency, throughput, and resource utilization
**RAI-Specific Instrumentation**: Specialized tracking for retrieval quality, context relevance, and generation accuracy
**Visual Analytics**: Interactive dashboards and trace visualization
**Alerting System**: Configurable alerts for performance degradation and system anomalies
**Integration Support**: Easy integration with popular AI frameworks and vector databases

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

**Trace Collector**: Gathers telemetry data from instrumented applications
**API Gateway**: RESTful APIs for programmatic access
